# chess_engine_from_scratch
A chess engine I built from scratch to refine my C++ skills.

# Current progress
This repo is a work in progress that aims to show my skills as I develop. If this message is still here, the engine is not complete yet.

# Rules progress
All rules are implemented. I am going through and refactoring to follow a more object-oriented approach. This is to help interface better with the engine. Once all bug fixes are done, I will start on the engine.

# Engine plans

After getting the basic functionality working, I will start on the engine. 

## Goals for engine

I want to create an engine in the style of AlphaZero, with my own modifications. Most projects I see use stockfish, but I will be implementing something different

Eventually I will connect this to the lichess API and register it as a bot.

That's all for now! If you have any questions or inquiries, reach me at my twitter: @kamdynshaeffer Cheers! :)
