# chess_engine_from_scratch
A chess engine I built from scratch to refine my C++ skills.

# Current progress
This repo is a work in progress that aims to show my skills as I develop. If this message is still here, the engine is not complete yet.

I have almost all the rules in place. There are some minor bugs with existing rules still to fix. 

## Rules I have not yet implemented at all:
- [ ] Any rules related to check(includes pinned pieces, moving into check, or various checkmating rules)
- [ ] En Passant

## Rules that are implemented but buggy:
- [ ] Castling
- [ ] Certain King moves

## Rules that have been implemented already:
- [x] All moves for queen
- [x] All moves for bishop
- [x] All moves for knights
- [x] All moves for rooks
- [x] All moves, besides en passant, for pawns

# Engine plans

After getting the basic functionality working, I will start on the engine. 

## Goals for engine

I want to create an engine in the style of AlphaZero, with my own modifications. Most projects I see use stockfish, but I will be implementing something different

Eventually I will connect this to the lichess API and register it as a bot.

That's all for now! If you have any questions or inquiries, reach me at my twitter: @kamdynshaeffer Cheers! :)
